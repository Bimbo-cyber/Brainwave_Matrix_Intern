PHISHING LINK SCANNER:
As part of my cybersecurity internship, I developed a Phishing Link Scanner Tool using Python on Kali Linux. The goal was to create a simple but effective solution that can help identify and flag suspicious URLs commonly used in phishing attacks.

TOOL USED:
Python – Core scripting language for URL analysis and logic

Kali Linux – Penetration testing OS used for development and testing

Storm Breaker – For social engineering and reconnaissance capabilities

Ngrok – To expose the scanner service over the internet for testing purposes

FEATURES:
Scans and analyzes suspicious links

Detects phishing keywords and known malicious patterns

Verifies against trusted domains

Checks SSL certificate and domain age (basic)

Designed to be lightweight and easy to run on Kali

SKILLED GAINED:
Python scripting for cybersecurity applications

URL parsing, regex, and HTTP header inspection

Ethical hacking tools like Storm Breaker

Hosting and tunneling with Ngrok

Project collaboration and GitHub version control
